This is the AVR Ultimate Drivers Pack for ATMega328/ATTiny/ARDUINO.

All drivers are in C and can be compiled into a driver lib using:

	cmake . && make

NOTE: if you don't have cmake, you don't need it. Just add the files you need to your own project makefile and compile them in as is. 

I have not tested ALL of the drivers, but I have used many of them. Some drivers may need configuration on your part. But all the code is there to study and improve.

One improvement that can be done is interrupt support for all the drivers.

New drivers:

* avrbus.c - driver for my custom SPI with addressing support

* time.c - timer driver that runs timer1 at clock speed and can calculate exact delays and timeouts.

Usage:

Many of the driver header files are pretty much self explanatory. You first init the device, then communicate with it. Then debug if it doesn't work :) If it doesn't work, it could be that you have connected your device to wrong pins that are not configured in the driver. But once you get your hardware wired correctly, the drivers should work fine.
